# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

### **Introduction**

This notebook is basically on twitter sentiment analysis. For beigninners in Natural Language Processing, Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea.

So from the definition above, you can see that twitter sentiment can be used by brand to get opinion about their products and classify it into either negative, positive or neutral.

However, on this notebook, I will analyze the twitter sentiment analysis of a popular and controversial  fan of an Ex-Big Brother Naija Housemate , Beauty Etukara.

On my next tutorial on sentiment analysis, I will specificall talk about drugs sentiment analysis. The essence of this analysis is to help newbies relate to what sentiment analysis is all about.

There are two concepts involved in sentiment analysis. These are:
- Subjectivity and
- Polarity

To make this clear, what is subjectivity and polarity?

Subjectivity "quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information". Subjectivity is therefore the consumer feelings and emotions about a particular situation, product and services.

Polarity on the other hand is a numeric score in the range of negative one (-1) to positive one (+1) to indicate the intensity of how negative or positive the sentiment is.

In this project, I used a scatter plot to analysis the twitter polarity and from the scattered plot, you can deduce that there are more positive tweet than negative tweet and because of this, the values are alligned to the positive side more than the negative

The intresting thing about this analysis is that the controversial fan and reason for this work convinced people through her activities and tweets that she's negative but guess the assumption is wrong. Feom the sentiment visualization above, you can confirm that it is more like a neutral concept than a negative perception.

You can see this on the countplot or even using the percentage value
